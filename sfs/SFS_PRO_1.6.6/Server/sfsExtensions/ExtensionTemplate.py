# An object called _server is available in the global scope
# The object is used to access the server side framework, just like in Actionscript extensions 
#

# Initializion point:
# 
# this function is called as soon as the extension
# is loaded in the server.
# 
# You can add here all the initialization code

#
# This method is called by the server when an extension
# is being removed / destroyed.
# 
# Always make sure to release resources like setInterval(s)
# open files etc in this method.
# 
# In this case we delete the reference to the databaseManager
